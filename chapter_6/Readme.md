Study Drills:

Lines with strings inside strings 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 21

Adding strings makes a longer string since strings
are actually arrays and a new array is made from the two smaller arrays.

Double quotes are required for interpolation otherwise the #{} is just
expressed literally.

Rubocop corrections:

Deleted trailing line.

STRING INTERPOLATION IS USED 9 TIMES BY HAVING VARIABLES(SOME CONTAINING
CONTAINING INTERPOLATION) WITHIN A STRING.

HIS CLAIM OF ONLY 4 APPEARS TO BE A LIE.
