Study Drills:

Lines with strings inside strings 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 21

Adding strings makes a longer string since strings
are actually arrays and a new array is made from the two smaller arrays.

Double quotes are required for interpolation otherwise the #{} is just
expressed literally.

Rubocop corrections:

Deleted trailing line.
