> If you type the exercise as it's written in the chapter, Rubocop will
complain about the double quoted strings.  In the Readme.md for this
directory, explain how you got rid of the offenses.  Did you fix the
strings?  Or did you tell Rubocop to ignore those code style violations?
Why did you pick what you did?

I replaced double quotes with singles for lines 1-5.

Line 6 was not changed.  I later added a "#" at the beginning to change
it to a comment.  It no longer prints when the program is run.

Line 7 was not changed.

Line 8 is where I added my one sentence to print.

Another error that I corrected was a long sentence that needed to split
into two lines (just like this one).

My final error correction was deleting a trailing line.
