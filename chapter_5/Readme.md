Rubocop corrections:

Trailing blank lines deleted.

Inserted space between * and variable name where space
was missing.

Also, I realized that I was trying to correct trailing
blank line at line 22 for about 15 minutes before I
noticed the error was in the next exercise for ex6.rb.

I tried using some string sequence formatting but later
deleted since it showed an error in Rubocop.
