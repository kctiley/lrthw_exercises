What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

>The three most essential skills are A, B, C

A is  reading and writing.   B is attention to detail.  C is spotting differences.

> Please explain these three skills in your own words.

Reading and writing are important because a programmer needs to be able to read and understand
various ideas and concepts and be able to explain them while also being able to
type and enter ideas and commands quickly and efficiently.  Typing is a basic skill
that is extremely important to keep pace and be effective.

Attention to detail is important since programming is all about the details.  Developing
a programs that works precise and literal commands.  Understanding details is essential
to proper function.  A single space or missing quotation can cause failure.

Spotting differences builds on the attention to detail concept.  Being able to compare
details is essential to compare programs which may be written differently but work the same,
differently, or not at all as a result of different design or syntax error.



> Why do you need to not copy and paste?

>You should not copy and paste because _______.

Typing is very important for efficiency.  Programming requires efficient typing and some
unusual key strokes, and practice makes perfect (or at least closer to perfect).  Copy
and paste does skips the process of learning to type efficiently.


> Why is Practice and Persistence important?

Practice is important for developing any skill.  Practice often includes making mistakes.
Persistence involves making mistakes and understanding that you are learning while you make
mistakes.  Eventually, ideas and details that were once foreign become assimilated into your
skill and knowledge set through the process of repeated attempts.
